### What is the goal of this page?

The aim of this page is to connect Corona test laboratories and health authorities with institutions such as universities, which could provide equipment, consumables and also qualified personnel to assist in the execution of Corona tests.

## For Donor Institutions

### How can I offer material / personnel?

Material and personnel can be offered on our website, a questionnaire has to be filled in so that the test facilities can search for the required resources.


## For Recipients

### How can I request material / personnel?

You can search for material and people in our database, divided by the categories: devices, consumables and personnel. Within these categories you will find the offers of the universities with the exact specifications (e.g. device designation, number of consumables, employee qualifications etc.)

### Are there any offers in my area?

The easiest way to transfer is, of course, for nearby institutions, so offers are sorted by postcode.
