### How is my staff insured?

The test facilities are supported by students and university staff on a voluntary basis. The helpers are legally insured through the DGUV (German Statutory Accident Insurance). In Bavaria, the Bavarian Volunteer Insurance has continued to ensure since 2007 that volunteers do not suffer any disadvantages in their engagement if they do not have adequate insurance coverage themselves. The Bavarian volunteer insurance consists of liability and accident insurance. The Bavarian voluntary insurance is free of application and contributions, the costs are borne solely by the Free State of Bavaria.
